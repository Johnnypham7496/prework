                <h3>What's your dream job?</h3>

                <p class="paragraph">I love computer engineering and all sorts of tech jobs but hoppy wise and dream job would be creating content for 
                    video games or some type of vlog. I get there's a lot of editing that goes into each video/project but being able to do it confortably
                    and creating content on your own time is a confortable life I believe.

                    coding world. I've tried other roles but the world of computer science always seems to pull me back
